# SOME BASIC IMPORTANT COMMAND
#git init (Means track  all the files git
#git status
#git add --a (this form is possible)
#git add ( Means when your file untrack then you are track any file to use git add command)
#git commit (git commit means any changes the file so means how many insert the new changes or deletion)
#git remote  git url( means when your local file  to git hub server  then git remote command
#git push  -u origin master 
#git pull -u origin master (means any other branch of code of is merge in parent branch (master) branch)
# git pull (changes the commit)
 # How to pull request so simple before merging the branch before any other branch name changes and commit that branch
 
and after that branch is merge .      

# git ignore (git ignore means when git add and file is add and commit but file is not direct commit then used as git ignore command
  so basically.

# How to ignore extra file -

# simple touch .gitignore file used and 
Example suppose my ab.c file extra generate so simple file inside gitignore file is save and then git status check and not show ab file so this command ignore the file
  means gitignore file inside file so file is ignore

But suppose lots file is show and see this type file simple -file ignore 
Example - means suppose  a.c,b.c,ab.c,ac.c so i want to ignore .c file so simple
  Inside gitignore file all dot c (.c) file only ( * .c) this form represent then ignore all files very simple command
and save gitignore file and at commit time not show (.c )file git file 

# Suppose you want to ignore directory so simple this command - Directory ignore
 inside gitignore file only this command (dir /) (means ignore the dir folder) simple this command 

All folder ignore but only outer folder ignore then simple (/dir )this command used and inner folder is tracked and 
outer folder is untracked.

#   How to used git diff command

# git diff command basically staging area and working directory of compare the file.staging area red color and green 
color is working directory.
# When  git add and afterthat press git status , so all file is staging area and working directory is same 
 then no any modified file possible so git diff not any modified file show
 
Example - Means suppose any file is add then afterthat git status and check and file is staging area 
means all file is green color is show so all file is staging area and git diff is not run because all file is 
staging area already present .



Imp point- #git diff -- basically compare previous commit and current staging area.


 
  # How to git staging area to skipp 
  # git commit -a -m  "Any quotes can write" This is command (-a -m ) commit
  Means We want to staging area file (green color file  commit is skipp so
 
  so simple command git commit -a -m "Any commit pass" so this command 
  basically skipp the commit.means this command basically any tracked file is skipp or commit the track file
  and untrack file will not commit . Means that you are required commit is changes and other wise skipp the commit 
 this commnd through. 

#git log is show the all commit file (history is showing) 

# How to unstagge file( untracked file ).
 
# git restore -- stagged file name .

# How to previous file commit merge stagging file (current file) .

# git checkout -- file name

  # How to git v   

# How to create git branch  
 git checkout -b <branch name>
 git branch  (command basically check the which branch currently)

 git checkout thirsty (switch the branch)

  git branch 

   master
   thirsty

   Merge two branches

    My default branch is master
    and current branch is any branch suppose thirsty branch add

  git merge thirsty 

  and commit : wq and enter
  then branch are merge

so default branch is master branch merge 
 
 suppose merge master branch in thirsty current branch 


   
  # See What Branch You're On
   git status
  # List All Branches
   NOTE: The current local branch will be marked with an asterisk (*).
    To see local branches, run this command:
   command-> git branch
  # To see remote branches, run this command
   command-> git branch -r
  # To see all local and remote branches, run this command
   command-> git branch -a
  # Create a New Branch
     Run this command (replacing my-branch-name with whatever name you want)
    command -> git checkout -b my-branch-name
     ->You're now ready to commit to this branch.
  # Switch to a Branch In Your Local Repo:
    -> Run this command:
    commad -> git checkout my-branch-name
  # Switch to a Branch That Came From a Remote Repo
  1) To get a list of all branches from the remote, run this command:
   command-> gitpull
  # Run this command to switch to the branch
    git checkout --track origin/my-branch-name
  # Push to a Branch
    -> If your local branch does not exist on the remote, run either of these commands
    command-> git push -u origin my-branch-name
    command ->git push -u origin HEAD
  # NOTE: HEAD is a reference to the top of the current branch, so it's an easy way to push to a branch of the 
   same name on the remote. This saves you from having to type out the exact name of the branch!NOTE:
   HEAD is a reference to the top of the current branch, so it's an easy way to push to a branch of the 
  same name on the remote.
   ->If your local branch already exists on the remote, run this command
           git push
    #  Merge a Branch :
     -> 1)You'll want to make sure your working tree is clean and see what branch you're on. Run this command.
       command->git status
    -> 2) First, you must check out the branch that you want to merge another branch into 
      (changes will be merged into this branch). If you're not already on the desired branch, run this command
    -> command->git checkout master
   NOTE: Replace master with another branch name as needed
   -> 3)Now you can merge another branch into the current branch. Run this command.
      command ->git merge my-branch-name
   -> 4) NOTE: When you merge, there may be a conflict. Refer to Handling Merge Conflicts 
        (the next exercise) to learn what to do.
   # Delete Branches:
     ->To delete a remote branch, run this command
     command->git push origin --delete my-branch-name
     ->To delete a local branch, run either of these commands
    command->git branch -d my-branch-name
    command->git branch -D my-branch-name
   # NOTE: The -d option only deletes the branch if it has already been merged. 
    The -D option is a shortcut for --delete --force, which deletes the branch irrespective of its merged status.
     
This saves you from having to type out the exact name of the branch!  


# How to overwrite local changes with git pull

What is git stash?
git stash is a Git command that temporarily saves uncommitted changes so that you can switch branches or work on something else without losing your progress. It allows you to return to those changes later.
  1) Stash local changes: $ git stash
     git stash -> basically if changes any file so without commit can move to another branch
  -> git stash ->Enter directly commited id and then directly move to another branch like -> git checkout <branch name> -> switched the branch
  -> git stash list -> basically all the files modified without commits untracking and tracking files can use this command and all files automatically commited
  2) git stash pop applies the stash and removes it from history (git pop) command
  3) Pull changes from remote $ git pull
 -> If you want to retrive your changes just do : $ git stash apply

# git remove untracked files: delete untracked files from working tree
-> When having unnecessary files and dirs in your own local copy of a repository,and you want to delete
those files,in opposed to just ignore them(with.gitignore),you can use git clean to remove all files which are not tracked by git.
 # How to remove untracked files and directory
  1) Start wth a dry run to see what will be deleted $ git clean -n-d
  2) After you are sure,run the git clean command with-f flag: $ git clean-f-d
 # Git Tip: Instead of untracking files,a good practice is to prevent those files from being tracked in the first place by using.gitignore file.

# git unstage : unstage file from index:
-> When  you re adding files ($git add) to the working tree,you are adding them to the stagging area,meaning you are staging them.if you want Git
to stop tracking specific files on the working tree,you need to remove them from your stage files (.git/index)
 # How to unstage file(s) from index:
  -> keep the file but it from the index:
   -> $ git rm --cached<file-name>
   -> To leave the entire working tree untracked,unstage all files(clear your index):$ git reset
   -> git reset rm <file-name>
   -> You can also untrack files which already added to git repository based on .gitignore.
 
# Git Undo Merge : abort (cancel) a merge after ut happened
-> Sometimes you get in a situation (we 've all been there) where you merged branches and realize you need to undo the merge
because you do n't want to release the code you just merged.
  
  1) Checked to the master branch :$ git checkout master
  2) Run git log and get the id of the merge commit: $ git log --oneline
  3) Revert merge by commit id:$ git revert -m <merge-commit-id>
  4) Commit the revert and push changes to the remote repo: You can start putting on your packer face and pretend "nothing's happened".

 # Git Remove File: Remove file(s) from a commit on remote:
 You wish to delete a file(or files) on remote,maybe because it is deprecated or because this file not supported to be there in the first
 place.so,you wonder,what is the protocol to delete files from a remote git repository

 1) Remove your file(s)0:$ git rm <file-A> <file-B><file-C>
 2) Commit your changes: $ git commit -m "removing files"
 3) Push you changes to git:$ git push

# Git Uncommit:Undo the last commit
You made a commit but now you regret it.May be you committed secrets by accident -not a good idea -or maybe you want
to add more tests to your code changes.these are all legit reasons to undo your last commit.

# How to uncommit (undo) the last commit:
  1) To keep the changes from the commit you want to undo :$ git reset --soft HEAD^
  2) To destroy the changes from the commit you want to undo: $ git reset --hard HEAD^
 
 2) GIt Tip: git pre-commit hook is a built-in feature that lets you defines scripts that will run automatically before each commit.Use
 to reduce the need to cancel commits.

# Git diff between branches:When you are working with multiple git branches,it's important to be able to compare and contrast the differences
between two different branches on the same repository.You can do this using the $ git diff command.

# How to get the diff between two branches 
  1) Find the diff between the tips of the two branches : $ git diff branch_1....branch_2
  2) Produce the diff between two branches from common ancestor commit: $ git diff branch_1 ....branch_2
  3) Comparing files between branches:$ git diff branch1:file branch2:file

 4) Git Tip: dff-so-fancy is a great open source solution to make your diffs human readable.

# Git Delete Tag: Remove a tag from branch 
 In the case of a "buggy" release,you probably don't want someone to accidentally use the release linked to this tag.

 1) If you want  a remote tag <tag-name> to delete.and your remote is origin,then simply: $ git push origin:refs/tags/<tag-name>
 2) If you also need to delete the tag locally: $ git tag-d <tag-name>

# How to rename branch name after it was created
  1) Checkout to the branch you need to rename: $ git checkout <old-name>
  2) Rename branch name locally : $ git branch -m  <new-name>
  3) Delete old branch fron remote: $ git push origin:<old-name><new-name>
  4) Reset the upstrean branch for the new branch name:$ git push origin -u <new-name>
